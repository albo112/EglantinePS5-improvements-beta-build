"""The driver patches in tools/patch-radv-series, on the pinned Mesa.

tools/deps.json pins the Mesa revision and tools/build-radv.sh exports that revision. Patches that
are too big for tools/patch-radv-wsi.py's anchors go here, as plain git patches with their authors
in their headers (exploitizm's mesh shaders as compute and Oliv3rmoon's stall dump are not ours).

They apply in name order to a copy of the files they name, in .deps/work/radv-series, and the
result goes into the build export. tools/patch-radv-wsi.py and tools/patch-radv-memory-report.py
then start from that copy instead of the pinned checkout, so they run after this and keep their
anchors. Nothing here touches the Mesa checkout, and the pin, the driver's build id and with it the
cache UUID stay what they were.
